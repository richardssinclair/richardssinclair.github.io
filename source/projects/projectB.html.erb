            For my second project I made an app where you set a destination and enter a number of pubs to visit on the way.
            <br>
            The idea came from the frustration of going to the same pub on a Friday after lessons. My colleagues complained that we kept on going to the Black Horse in Aldgate East. I made the App in order to find new pubs and to organise better nights. We now go to the Leman street tavern across the road.
            <br>
            The Process.
            I found the Authentication part of the project really challenging. I really enjoyed styling aspect of the map. When I had the map on the screen things got easier. I seeded the pubs and locations as well as changing the pins on the map. I learnt a lot about the google maps api. It is such a powerful tool I just found it hard to control. Theres more I would like to learn about it.
            <br>
            The future of Pubbing.
            I would like to add more functionality to the app.
            <br>
            Being able to select and remove pubs you would like to visit on your route.
            <br>
            I seeded the pubs onto the map, in future I would like to experiment more with API’s and find an API for pubs that would be better than seeding data.
            <br>
            A function that helps you control your drinking. If you either try to visit too many pubs or add more pubs to the list the screen will start shaking so that you cant control the app.
            <br>
            A timer so it gives you a set time per pub, so you don’t get to distracted in one place.
