Overview
Having many stand ups where colleagues would talk about their dreams, in a team we created an online dream diary. We implemented a ‘mood board’ where a user can play calming sounds that will help them sleep. This was a great learning phase for me. I managed to pair with my team and learn how to tackle problems differently.

Team Orgainisation
When brainstorming initial concepts we kept up to date with ideas on Slack, each researching possible external API’s that could be used. Once the idea was decided we created Trello boards in order to plan what was to be completed each day and assigned each task to a member of the team. We also held three stand-ups a day to ensure everyone was up to speed with what was happening.

Wins
The definite win was how well we worked as a team. Being so orgainised and communicating always we had probably three conflicts on Git, and no tme wasted arguing about ideas. Instead we decided upon a clear MVP and any ideas a team member had would be added to the Trello board. Then when MVP was achieved we coud prioritised which features to add.

Challenges
I think each member of the team found their own challenges with the tasks they were assigned, but I think what was great about how we worked is that it was mostly pair programming, and so problems were resolved quicker and with less fustration.
Of course one challenge of working in a team is always seeing code be deleted, though this happened only a couple times it was hard sometimes to voice issues with design or fucntionality, even though it would improve the site.

Improvements
Overall I’m really happy with how the final site came out, though I love its minimalistic feel I think there’s also so much room to expand upon.

A speech to text input so the user could speak out their dream as soon as they woke.
Playing around with ngCharts to look at sleeping patterns the user had.
This could then lead to a group stats page which all users could access, to see how their sleep compares to others.
Having a page with all users things like forums could be explored, either in entertaining way where people share their dreams, or, in a more serious way for people who have trouble with their sleep.
