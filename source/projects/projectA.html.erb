          After two weeks of learning Javascript, I created a simple hangman game themed on music lyrics, the missing words would be picked at random so it would always be different. I learnt a lot about Javascript and CSS with this project.

          The Process
          I found Javascript quite challenging, having only learnt it for two weeks, I found writing the logic quite challenging, having said that I learnt a lot about Javascript. I also learnt to do pseudo code in order to help planing the project before jumping into it.

          My favorite part was styling the project. I used a giff from giphy and I just kep a nice white border arround it in order to keep it neat and tidy.

          The audio is plain old elevator music which is just a simple touch to make the app pleasent and fun to play on.

          Tech used
          HTML 5
          CSS3
          Javascript / jQuery.
