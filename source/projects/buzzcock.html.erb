            After two weeks of learning Javascript, I created a simple hangman game themed on music lyrics, the missing words would be picked at random so it would always be different. I learnt a lot about Javascript and CSS with this project.
            <br>
            The Process
            <br>
            I found Javascript quite challenging, having only learnt it for two weeks, I found writing the logic quite challenging, having said that I learnt a lot about Javascript. I also learnt to do pseudo code in order to help planing the project before jumping into it.
            <br>
            My favorite part was styling the project. I used a giff from giphy and I just kep a nice white border arround it in order to keep it neat and tidy.
            <br>
            The audio is plain old elevator music which is just a simple touch to make the app pleasent and fun to play on.
            <br>
            Tech used:
            HTML 5,
            CSS3,
            Javascript / jQuery.
