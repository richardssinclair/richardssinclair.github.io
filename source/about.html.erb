      <p>
        I have a background in fine arts, primarily sculpting and photography. Over a year ago I attended a creative coding meet up and was inspired by what I saw - immersive animations, games and portfolios all done in Javascript. I was amazed by what people had done in the digital world where the limit is down to your imagination. I became really interested in front end development and completed the Web Development course at General Assembly.
        Since then I have done internships at Goodgym and Iron SLS giving me experience at delivering production code. I primarily worked on templating and styling new pages using HTML, SASS and JavaScript . I am now looking for a creative place to establish myself as a front end developer.

        Growing up in a creative environment I developed skills in paint, sculpting, photography and film I became really passionate about the arts. A few months ago I was inspired by a creative coding meet up where I saw amazing animations, games and portfolios all done in Javascript. This inspired me to become a Developer. I was amazed by what people had done in the digital world where the limit is down to your imagination. I joined the Web Developer Immersive Course at General Assembly where I learnt new skills in web developing and am now looking for a new role where I can develop these skills further.
