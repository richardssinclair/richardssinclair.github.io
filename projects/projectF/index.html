          I have always been passionate about Art, I was always drawing, painting, making things. I had a mentor from the age of 8 who taught me how to paint and sculpt. Art was something I have always been obsessed about.

          I studied Fine Art at university. During my time at there I was inspired by music and my home country Portugal. Using paper and resin I made life-size paper stencils of Fado musicians from the 1950’s holding resin instruments.

          I also developed an interest in photography, film and Architecture. I found all media equally fascinating. My interest for code came later after seeing how an artist mixed code, sculpture and sound. Seeing the mix just blew my mind and a month later I was at General Assembly.

          Coding is an interesting form of Art where you are not bound to properties of the physical world. The limit is your imagination which is something I am hoping to explore.

          My art is something I will always carry on doing. If you would like to see a selection of my artwork you can find it here
